# 2Ddiffeqsolver
This program solves 2 dimensional differential equations using matrices and then plots the corresponding gradient field 

It solves differential equations of the form a\*dz/dx + b\*dz/dy = z

Note: this includes equations such as dz/dx + dz/dy = b\*z which is what was the original goal, but I did more whoops
